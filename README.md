# Greetings! 
## This app gives us a detailed overview of weather and forecasts of different places. It has an Auto Search feature which lets use take suggestions. It gives us a 7 day forecast, also provides details based on Pressure, Humidity, Wind Speed, etc.



### Steps on running this project: 1)Please check with the pre-requisites before running this app: Go to your device's command prompt/terminal and type node -v and npm -v
### That should provide you with the version of Node and NPM available in your device. If it's not installed, please install it from nodejs.org.
### Create a folder where you'd like to test this project. Clone this project with the help of git using command "git clone HTTPs_link".
### Copy the HTTPs link for this github repository from here and paste it in the command.
### Go to that folder where you stored the project, open it with Visual Studio Code.
### Versions in the JSON file and others might differ, so please run "npm start" and then run "npm install" in the terminal of VS Code.
### When the project is setup to be tested, please run the "npm start" command again in VS Code terminal. Then the project will redirect you to localhost: 3000 of your pc.

# Getting Started with Create React App

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
